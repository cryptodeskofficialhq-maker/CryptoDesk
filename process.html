    <div class="subtle">How We Operate</div>
    <h1>Process</h1>

    <p>
      CryptoDesk follows a structured, repeatable process.
      The goal is consistency, discipline, and controlled participation —
      not speed or volume.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Market Context</h3>
      <p>
        Every decision starts with understanding context.
        Broader conditions matter more than isolated moments.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Risk Definition</h3>
      <p>
        Risk is defined before participation.
        If risk cannot be clearly understood, no action is taken.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Structured Participation</h3>
      <p>
        Participation follows predefined frameworks.
        Impulse and emotion are deliberately removed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Execution Discipline</h3>
      <p>
        Actions are taken only when conditions align.
        Consistency matters more than frequency.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>5. Review & Accountability</h3>
      <p>
        Outcomes are reviewed objectively.
        Learning is continuous and responsibility is individual.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>6. Long-Term Improvement</h3>
      <p>
        The process is refined over time.
        Growth comes from discipline and reflection, not shortcuts.
      </p>
