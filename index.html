        <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
        <p>This private desk is designed specifically for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traders who have lost significant capital and are tired of emotional decisions or following random signals.</li>
            <li>People who want to rebuild proper trading habits with real structure and risk control.</li>
            <li>Individuals seeking a calm, no-hype environment to focus on discipline and long-term improvement — not quick riches.</li>
            <li>Anyone ready to trade their own account responsibly, with guidance on process instead of promises.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If that sounds like you, CryptoDesk provides the framework to start again the right way.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Why CryptoDesk</h2>
        <p>Retail traders lose due to emotion, noise, lack of structure. CryptoDesk focuses on rules, confirmation, disciplined execution.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Every participation follows a clear, repeatable structure to remove emotion and build discipline:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Context</strong> — Understand the bigger picture: market conditions, liquidity, key levels (your own analysis only).</li>
            <li><strong>Confirmation</strong> — Wait for multiple factors to align before any action. Use checklists to avoid impulse.</li>
            <li><strong>Execution</strong> — Define exact entry, position size, stop loss, and target — risk no more than planned per trade.</li>
            <li><strong>Review</strong> — After the trade, journal what happened, what you learned, and how to improve next time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This cycle is repeated consistently. No shortcuts, no hype — just structured personal trading.</p>

        <h2>Risks & Rules</h2>
        <p>CryptoDesk supports disciplined personal trading for those rebuilding responsibly. Key principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trading carries real risk of capital loss due to volatility and other factors.</li>
            <li>This is an educational space only — no financial advice, signals, recommendations, or guarantees.</li>
            <li>You trade your own account exclusively — we never handle funds or execute trades.</li>
            <li>Outcomes depend on your own execution, risk control, and adherence to process.</li>
            <li>Discipline is required: follow structure, manage risk per trade, review honestly.</li>
            <li>Access is selective; we review applications and may remove rule violators.</li>
            <li>By joining, you are 18+, accept these terms, and take full responsibility for decisions and losses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-style: italic; opacity: 0.85;">We function like a small private desk — focused, rule-based, no shortcuts.</p>
